ðŸ‘‹ Hey There. I am Yulun, or you may call me Allen. 

I recently graduated the University of California - Santa Barbara in in Chemical Engineering and moved to Ithaca, New York to begin an M.S. in Materials Science & Engineering at Cornell.

My research interests span heterogeneous catalysis, process design & optimization, and high-performance energy storage â€” work that, I hope, helps move us toward using cleaner energy.

I am originally from Zhengzhou, China, a city with a rich cultural history along the Yellow River. Growing up in such a vibrant and historically significant place has shaped my curiosity and appreciation for both tradition and innovation. During my time at UCSB, I loved living in Santa Barbara -- its beautiful scenery and ocean breeze make it an easy place to relax and explore. I am excited about this next chapter at Cornell â€” the winter, the gorges and trails, and the chance to grow in the best community and research environment.

In my free time, you can find me hanging out with friends, playing video games or board games, and enjoying TV shows and movies, especially those in the end-of-the-world survival genre. A fun fact about me: I used to be a huge fan of Coke and Boba tea, but I've recently switched to water -- it's better for maintaining a healthy bodily weight and staying energized! 

Feel Free to explore my website to learn about my work and experiences! I hope that by navigating through my experiences, projects, blog, and backgrounds, you have a better understanding of me and my journey.
