ðŸ‘‹ Hey There. I am Yulun, or you may call me Allen. 

I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing a B.S degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

My research interest spans from hetereogeneous catalysis and process optimization to high-performance energy storage technologies helping the world transition to using clean energy.

I am originally from Zhengzhou, China, a city with a rich cultural history along the Yellow River. Growing up in such a vibrant and historically significant place has shaped my curiosity and appreciation for both tradition and innovation. Outside academics, I love living in Santa Barbara -- its beautiful scenery and ocean breeze make it the perfect place to relax anzzd explore. In my free time, you can find me hanging out with friends, playing video games or board games, and enjoying TV shows and movies, especially those in the end-of-the-world survival genre. A fun fact about me: I used to be a huge fan of Coke and Boba tea, but I've recently switched to water -- it's better for maintaining a healthy bodily weight and staying energized!


Feel Free to explore my website to learn about my work and experiences! I hope that by navigating through my experiences, projects, blog, and backgrounds, you have a better understanding of me and my journey.
