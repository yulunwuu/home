title: "Real Gas Behavior – Compressibility Factor via Burnett Method"
excerpt: "Measured compressibility factors (Z) and second virial coefficients of CO₂ and He between 15–35 °C using the Burnett expansion method. Analyzed deviations from ideal gas law, showing Z<1 for CO₂ and Z>1 for He, with temperature-dependent virial coefficients. Strengthened background in thermodynamics, real gas modeling, and data regression."
