title: "Production of Benzene by Hydrodealkylation (HDA) of Toluene – Techno-Economic Design"
excerpt: "Designed a conceptual benzene production process (100 kta) using an adiabatic plug flow reactor. Built detailed reactor/recycle models in Python and Aspen HYSYS, integrated distillation and heat exchanger networks, and performed cost estimation. Delivered a full techno-economic analysis showing feasibility with an IRR of 40% and an NPV of ~$50M, while also addressing CO₂ emissions and process safety>"
