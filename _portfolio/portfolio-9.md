This project involves a three-step synthesis of Nylon-6,6, which is a widely used polyamide known for its mechanical durabilities and thermal resistance. Starting with cyclohexene, the synthesis pathway leverages phase transfer catalysis and interfacial polymerization to efficiently produce Nylon-6,6, the target polymer.
