Designed a sleep apnea monitoring device using an Arduino, HW-502 heartbeat sensor, and HW-496 sound sensor. The system tracked heart rate and snoring, triggering an alarm upon apnea detection. An LCD displayed real-time heart rate and apnea alerts, which ceased automatically upon detecting motion, improving sleep monitoring efficiency.
