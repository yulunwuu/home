Performed thermodynamic analysis of a turbojet engine to optimize performance. The project involved calculating efficiency, thrust, and fuel consumption, analyzing using various equations of state and energy balance principles to improve the engine's thermodynamic cycle.​ The report also analyzes the profit margin across a few aviation fuel choices, based on their thermochemistry properties.
