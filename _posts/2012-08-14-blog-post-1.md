Hydrogen has long been considered the fuel powering the future -- a key player in the transitioning to a sustainable energy economy. However, according to Ballard Power Systems, the wide application of affordable and plentiful clean hydrogen is still years behind schedule. A recent article from Hydrogen Insights highlights the challenges the industry faces, including high production costs and slow infrastructure development. 


While green hydrogen holds great promise, it still remains much more expensive than grey hydrogen, which is derived from fossil fuels. This difference in cost, along with the lack of infrastructure, has hindered the adoption of hydrogen as a clean energy source. However, companies like Ballard continue to innovate in clean hydrogen and fuel cell technology, pushing hydrogen closer to widespread use in our society. Significant investment and policy support would become the key to make this a reality. 


As someone who researches green hydrogen production, I know the journey toward a sustainable future is a road full of challenges, but the potential rewards would be worth the effort! üöÄ
